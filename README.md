## Introduction

### Areas of interests and project alignment

### Research project

With this project we want to turn the city into a navigable space without individual digital devices (mobile phones). Add elements of signaling routes, important information of areas of the city and spaces for receiving feedback from citizens. To be able to "talk" to the city, to be able to collect proposals from citizens in an interactive, community and easy to use way.

In order to start the project it is necessary to collect data on the needs of the city's inhabitants to be able to incorporate them into the new "gamified city" system.

### Artifact description

City companion that gives the opportunity to the citizens to talk to the city and (maybe) recieve feed back from her.

The artifact we will design is an easy, interactive and accessible way for citizens to give feedback on the city about what do they want. It must be safe, anonymous, appealing and useful for the project.

### Microphone

We found out the audio input can only come from USB, not AUX for the Raspberry Pi. 

To find a microphone that checked the requirements, we decided to go with a speaker/microphone headset. At the beginning it wasn't working, and we thought it was too confusing to have 2 functions in the same input for the Raspberry Pi. We realized the microphone of the headset wasn't working, and when we changed it for another headset, the code worked.

As a way to cover a little bit the mic and reduce background and wind sound, we covered it with a noise filter.

### Button

We used a similar button to the one we needed for our project of The Machine Paradox, so for the sake of reusing we extracted it from the previous machine and used it for this new one.

The button was an easy configuration, we plugged it into the Raspberry Pi pins. It was more difficult to figure out which commands we needed to use for each pin. But once we figured it out, it worked.



### Structure

To collect the electronic parts and all the elements we designed a box to be manufactured by laser cutting. The box was placed on a metal structure that we recycled from Iaac, and for the support of the main poster, we laser cut a round structure that would hold the main poster straight.
